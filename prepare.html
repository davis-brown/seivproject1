                <h3> Determine Why You Want to Study Computer Science? </h3>
                <br>
                <p> 
                    Before you embark on your computer science journey, it would be beneficial to clarify your purpose for studying this field. 
                    This might sound very simple for some people, but solidifying your driving force for learning CS will help you stick to it long term. 
                    It is very common people to be drawn to Computer Science for the potential monetary benfits. However, these individuals can not follow through because they lack interest and curosity for computers.

                <h3> Find Friends and Network </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Network with everyone you know! Friends at all levels of Computer Science can be beneficial to you. 
                    Making new friends who are also interested in learning Computer Science will help you stay motivated and answer any questions you might have.
                    Connections in the Computer Science industry could also lead to job oppurtunities in the future. 
                    You should try to join any local Computer Science clubs and communities; Github can also be a great resource to make new connections.
                </p>

                <h3>Research and Find a Specialization </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Determining a specialization to pursue may take time and experimentation. 
                    You might need to learning the basics of a couple specializations before you find what you really want to do.
                    However, once you find what you are interested in then you can focus your learning efforts and find specific resources on it.
                    A few of the common specializations are: Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Game Design, and Data Science.
