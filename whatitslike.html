            <h1>What is it Like as a Computer Science Major?</h1>
            <br>
            <p> 
                As a Computer Science major, I tried to summarize what I experienced in this field in these few general points.
                If you believe that these common practices in Computer Science are enjoyable then Computer Science will be a great major for you.

                <h3> Lots and Lots of Problem Solving </h3>
                <br>
                <p> 
                    Problem Solving is an essential skill for this field, and it will be required on the majority of your homework and job tasks.
                    In fact, programming is simply telling the computer how to solve problems. It is also neccessary to find errors within your programs.
                    Error checking is just another form of problem solving. As you can see, problem solving is a neccessity for the basic functions of Computer Scientist.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3> Learning Inside and Outside of Class </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Continuous learning is neccessary for every level of Computer Science. The programming languages and tools of the industry change more rapidly than any other field.
                    As a computer scientist, it is vital that you stay up to date current technologies to produce software with maximum efficiency and security.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3> Collaborative Work </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Many people have the preconception that computer scientist generally work on software alone. However, it is quite the opposite.
                    The majority of software is developed in teams with a development process in place. 
                    Therefore, many of the assignments to acheive a computer science degree require collaboration with a team.
